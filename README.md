## Description

This image is based on the [Docker Container for Logitech Media Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/larsks/logitech-media-server/) ([Github](https://github.com/larsks/docker-image-logitech-media-server)). It was adapted according to the PR by [RaymondMouthaan](https://github.com/RaymondMouthaan) to support additional architectures. The source can be found on [github](https://github.com/DOliana/docker-image-logitech-media-server).

Until the PR is reviewed this is a testing image.

### Changes
- 15.03.2021
  - Add Dockerfile for latest supported Logitec Server 7.9.3
- 10.01.2021
  - due to changes in the update-api, only the latest stable community version is now supported (currently 8.1.0)
  - removed old and unused tags
  - introduced "latest-version" tag that represents the versions received by update-api (<http://www.mysqueezebox.com/update/>) - when a new version comes up, old versions will remain
- 20.07.2020
  - Consolidated image versions to
    - 7.9.2 - stable
    - 7.9.3 - stable
    - 7.9.4 - beta
    - 8.0 - alpha
- 19.07.2020
  - Add image for v8.0
- 11.06.2020
  - Adding ffmpeg dependency
- 9.6.2020:
  - Add support for Pulseaudio - enables use of the host speakers and WaveInput plugin with Pulseaudio
- 24.11.2019:
  - the "latest" tag has been removed - so either latest-7.9.2 or latest-7.9.0 should be used. This simplifies the deployment pipeline.
  - migrated from travis-ci to Azure DevOps pipeline

## Changes from original source

- Always use latest 7.9.X / 8.0 version from [mysqueezebox](http://downloads.slimdevices.com/nightly/index.php?ver=7.9)

## Usage (Copied from original instructions)

This is a Docker image for running the Logitech Media Server package
(aka SqueezeboxServer).

Run Directly:

    docker run -p 9000:9000 \
               -p 9090:9090 \
               -p 3483:3483 \
               -p 3483:3483/udp \
               -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
               -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
               -v <local-state-dir>:/srv/squeezebox \
               -v <audio-dir>:/srv/music \
               doliana/logitech-media-server:latest-7.9.2

The web interface runs on port 9000.  If you also want this available
on port 80 (so you can use `http://yourserver/` without a port number
as the URL), you can add `-p 80:9000`, but you *must* also include `-p
9000:9000` because the players expect to be able to contact the server
on that port.

## Using docker-compose

There is a [docker-compose-logitech-media-server.yml](https://github.com/DOliana/docker-image-logitech-media-server/blob/master/docker-compose-logitech-media-server.yml) included in this repository that
you will let you bring up a Logitech Media Server container using
`docker-compose`.  The compose file includes the following:

    volumes:
      - ${AUDIO_DIR}:/srv/music

To provide a value for `AUDIO_DIR`, create a `.env`
file that points `AUDIO_DIR` at the location of your music library,
for example:

    AUDIO_DIR=/home/USERNAME/Music

[docker-compose-logitech-media-server.yml]: docker-compose-logitech-media-server.yml

## File conversion (custom-convert.conf)

It is possible to define custom commands for the conversion of file types (Settings/Advanced/File Types) and to redefine existing ones. 
This is useful when the players do not support some file types, to make the server transcode to a supported file type, using predefined commands on the server.
There is little documentation of this feature. This (forum thread)[https://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?107012-Transcode-Resample-Custom-convert-conf] gives the basic steps.
To do this, create a `custom-convert.conf` file and mount it to your container by adding this volume directive (assuming the file is in the current working directory).

    -v $PWD/custom-convert.conf:/etc/squeezeboxserver/custom-convert.conf 

## Using with Pulseaudio

This container can use the host Pulseaudio server directly with those 2 steps:
Enable Pulseaudio UNIX socket on the host

    pactl load-module module-native-protocol-unix auth-anonymous=1 auth-cookie-enabled=0 socket=/tmp/pulseaudio.socket

When running the container, link the socket through a volume

    -v /tmp/pulseaudio.socket:/tmp/pulseaudio.socket
